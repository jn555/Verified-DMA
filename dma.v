  | S : nat -> nat

  1 is S 0
  2 is S (S 0)

Pointwise form of two blocks not overlappign

Useful despite us having the range level check between two memory blocks (disjoint_range)
as many lemmas need check for concrete address inequality (i.e. a != x).

To check that one specific address is different than another 
(i.e. index i of mem item a is different than j of mem item b).

Generalized, no element of the src address block equals any element of the dst address block
=
i and j pick particular addresses within the src and dst block, respectively

If the src and dst addresses (nats) are disjoint
then index i of src < n (total length of src)
then index j of dst < n (total length of dst)
then src + i != dst + j

So, if the src and dst ranges are disjoint (which is prereq for this)
then check that the indexed i of src is valid
then check that the indexed j of dst is valid
then check that the addresses plus indexes arent equal

Hdis Hi Hj and Heq are namings you assign to the hypothesis implications
All introduced into context with those names

If you write fewer names than there are arrows, the rest stay in the goal as implications

Since ~x = x -> false
And p -> q = ~p v q

x | ~x v false
1 | 0
0 | 1

(x <> y) is notation for ~ (x = y)
(src + i <> dst + j) is notation for ~ (src + i <> dst + j)
which gets expanded into (src + i = dst + j) -> false 

So, the mapping is:
Hdis : (disjoint_range src dst n)
Hi : (i < n)
Hj : (j < n)
Heq : (src + i = dst + j)

So all these are introduced as assumptions

And what's left is -> false
And that's the new goal

_______
Destruct Hdis as [H | H]
Hdis : (disjoint_range src dst n)

This is case analysis on disjunction

Since disjoint_range is:
    a + n <= b \/ b + n <= a.
It has 2 terms: a \/ b
So H | H

Then there are two branches, one taken for each of the destructed terms

Lia is built in solver to prove this inequality property.

Lemma disjoint_indices_ne (src dst n i j : nat) :
  (disjoint_range src dst n) ->
  (i < n) ->
  (j < n) ->
  (src + i <> dst + j).

  intros Hdis Hi Hj Heq. 
  destruct Hdis as [Hleft | Hright];
