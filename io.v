(* 
  Identify pins by number for now. 
*)
Definition Pin := nat.

(* 
  Value carried by a pin each tick.
  Using booleans currently, may change
 *)

Definition Val := bool.

(* 
  What a pin reads before it has any samples. 
*)
Definition default : Val := false.


(* 
  Pins history, ordered oldest to newest. 
*)
Definition Trace := list Val.

(* 
  Lookp table for the whole board: for any pin, give me its trace. 
*)
Definition Board := Pin -> Trace.


(* 
  Return the last sample of a trace, or [d] if the trace is empty.
  We reverse to make the last element the head, then pattern match/deconstruct 
*)
Definition last_with (d:Val) (tr:Trace) : Val :=
  match rev tr with
  | [] => d
  | v :: _ => v

Check last_with.

  fun p' =>
    if Nat.eqb p p'
    then b p' ++ [v]
    else b p'.

(* 
  For a single pin: repeat its last value this tick.
  If the trace is empty, we use [default].

  write_pin b p (last_with default (b p)).

(* 
  Functions in coq are total, this means they must be defined
   for every antecedent of that type; so, you must be able to call
   it on every pin. 
   
   Thus, it either returns some or none, depending
   on if its being updated in that tick. 
  *)
Definition Update := Pin -> option Val.

(* 
  Apply one tickâ€™s worth of updates:
   For each pin p, append exactly one new sample:
     - if upd p = Some v, append v (component drives p this tick)
     - if upd p = None, append the held value (repeat last; default if empty) 

  given board and update type (mapping every pin to new value
  for that tick, some or none), output a new board with those changes

  since the whole thing has a board type and board maps pin->trace,
  coq infers p is of type pin, and that the consequent must produce a trace.

  b p is function application by juxtaposition, b is applied to p
  and since board is pin -> trace, board->pin->trace (think of it as curried function)

  ++ is concatenation, so to the trace you're adding the result of the
  match expression

  if Val is none, then get the latest value in the trace and append
  that value again to the trace, so for next tick same value repeated
